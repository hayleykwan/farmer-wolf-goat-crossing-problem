# farmer-wolf-goat-crossing-problem
A twist to the classic problem of a farmer crossing the river bank from north to south 
with a wolf, goat, cabbage and a bag of fertiliser. 

The solution to the problem is implemented in Prolog.

A sequence of moves that the farmer can take can be computed by inputting
succeeds(Seq). in a Prolog environment.

The program is developed in the Sicstus environment.
